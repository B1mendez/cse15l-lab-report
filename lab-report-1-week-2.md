**Part 1: Setting up VS code**

No image needed because vs code was already installed on the computer.To install vs code, go to vscode website and download the latest version. When completing this, install the java extensions, which can be found towards the right activity bar. 

**Part 2: Remote Connectivity**

To connect your client to the server go to a command terminal (cmd) or the terminal in vscode (vs code terminal is used in this example). your ssh command followed by your account name will allow you to connect to the server. You will be followed by a password statement where you will copy and paste or type out your password in and successfully login to the server (do not worry if you can not see chararcters being typed, it is still taking in your input) <br/>

**Part 3: Try Some New Commands**

When successfully connecting to the server you will be able to use a number of command like ls -lat (shown in the image). This command lists the directory contents in the server and associated with your account.
